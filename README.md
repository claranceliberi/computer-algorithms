What is algorithm ? <br> 
Basically algorithm is  a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or problems solving, especially by computer

## 1. Algorithm Analysis & Complexity

It is very common for beginning computer science students to compare their programs with one another. You may also have noticed that it is common for computer programs to look very similar, especially the simple ones. An interesting question often arises. When two programs solve the same problem but look different, is one program better than the other?
<br>
In order to answer this question, we need to remember that there is an important difference between a program and the underlying algorithm that the program is representing. As we stated in Chapter 1, an algorithm is a generic, step-by-step list of instructions for solving a problem. It is a method for solving any instance of the problem such that given a particular input, the algorithm produces the desired result. A program, on the other hand, is an algorithm that has been encoded into some programming language. There may be many programs for the same algorithm, depending on the programmer and the programming language being used.

So basically *analysis of Algorithms* is concerned primarily with determining the memory (space) and time requirements(complexity) of an algorithm. 
<br>
The *complexity of an algorithm* is a function describing the efficiency of the algorithm in terms of the amount of data the algorithm must process.
The factor of time is usually more important than that of space, so efficiency considerations usually focus on the amount of time elapsed when processing data.
To evaluate an algorithmâ€™s efficiency, real-time units such as microseconds and nanoseconds should not be used. Rather, logical units that express a relationship between the size `n` of a file or an array and the amount of time t required to process the data should be used.
