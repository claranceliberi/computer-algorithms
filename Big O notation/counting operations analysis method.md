### Counting operations method in Big O
With this method we measure the perfomance of our algorithm by counting number of operations instead of manually timing it 
because the number of operations in your code is easy to standardize and remains consistent regaldless of computer, compared to manually timing our code.

so let's count operations in function `sumUpTo`

first method with `3` operations ( multiplication, adddition and division)

second method with `1 * N` operations ( one addition operation which will be repeated Nth time )

so let us test this with actual code
here we have two functions , and we are going to measure how long it is going to take to accomplish the task

Suprisingly, the time taken to accomplish the task is

as you can see function A with 3 operations took 0 seconds ( not actually 0 in time but there are little microseconds which are rounded to 0) while B with 4 operations took 2.97 seconds
